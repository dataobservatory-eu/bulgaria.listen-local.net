We are a Netherlands-based start-up company that makes big data reliable and accountable, delivering trustworthy analytics and AI solutions. We validate multiple data sources and are able to merge private and proprietary data with open data. We bring novel insight into policy and business problems, as well as scientific research. Our work addresses the potentially negative effects of black-box proprietary algorithms. Our diverse team is particularly experienced in music, the creative industries, and digital humanities, where data is scattered in small organizations.

We won the Audience Prize in the  **The Hague Innovators Award 2022** competition with roughly as many votes as the seven other competitors combined.
