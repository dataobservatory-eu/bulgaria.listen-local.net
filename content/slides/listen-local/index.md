## Curators

- Local curators (for festivals, clubs, radio stations, streaming playlists, and music export offices) to find relevant music locally and globally to place their artists into the correct scene, location, or playlist. 
- We want to hear more music created in Vilnius in the stores and radios of Vilnius. 
- We want to ensure that visitors to the city will take home new music discoveries.

## Artists and their team
Local artists to remain visible on global streaming platforms and the increasingly global selection pool of radios or festivals. Twenty years ago, artists competed for the attention of the local gatekeepers and competed with about 50,000 songs. On global platforms, they compete with about 2000x more, 100,000,000 recordings.

## Music lovers and educators

- Music lovers who want to find new artists they can personally meet and see on small stages in the neighborhood where they live, study or work, or go on vacation. 
- The current for-profit and intransparent AI systems recommend music from about 50 cities worldwide.

--- 

## Micro- and small music businesses

- Small labels, publishers, talent managers, and their represented artists, because they very often do not get paid or do not get fully paid on the complex, AI-driven autonomous systems of global platforms. 
- These platforms require perfect, tedious, detailed, and often updated data about each recording to pay royalties correctly. The documentation cost is greater than the expected revenue for small labels or small country artists in years. We want to help with open source solutions that bring automation and scale to their processes. 

--- 

## Music Support organizations
- Music export offices, music information centers, and collective management organizations in small countries do not have the cost and talent base to take benefit from modern data science when it comes to working with data on the scale and cheap. 
- We want to help them unleash the advantages of the semantic web, often called web 3.0. This way, we can radically reduce their IT and documentation costs and increase the quality of their data to perform their artist-supporting work better.

## Governments and cultural policy makers

- National governments ensure that algorithms do not undermine their cultural and copyright policy or music education goals. 
- We want to avoid that global music sales platforms, and AI-driven autonomous recommendation systems do not recommend local music to local audiences or relevant foreign audiences. 
- We want to ensure that children and teenagers find music pertinent to the local government's general music and cultural cohesion objectives.
