In Lithuanian, kūlgrinda means a secret stone-paved walkway under water across a swamp or lake, regarded in the old times as a sacred path of initiation. There’s a comparable air of mystery surrounding the songs, hymns, sutartinės (ancient polyphonic folk songs), prayers and dances performed by this ritual folklore group, accompanied by drums, bagpipes or other instruments. For their public performances the members of Kūlgrinda dress in traditional clothing, reconstructed from 10th-12th century archaeological finds, wear traditional Baltic brass jewellery and woven sashes ornamented with traditional patterns. However, they are by no means fundamentalists of ceremonial folklore and willingly present their music to new audiences in an adapted form, while their frequent collaborators from the electronic post-folk music scene know exactly how to do it. Kūlgrinda have presented numerous albums involving collaborations, while Oi lylialia kalnas kalnalis is from their upcoming album Giesmės Didžiajai Deivei.
