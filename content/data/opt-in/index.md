## Opt-in Database

The [Write-in Database](/data/write-in/) collects, contrasts, and if
necessary, corrects information about musical artists, and music work
(recordings). We only collect information about commercially released
music, because in this case, the artist and their representatives made
the music with information public and publicly retrievable. The Write-In
Database therefore does not require consent from the artist or the
artist‚Äôs representative.

The `Write-in Database` is a very important starting point to monitor
the performance of the local (national or regional) repertoire and
identify programs that make the music less visible, or may result in
late or missed payments.

However, the `Write-in Database` will invevitable contain many incorrect
or obsolete information, and often we will not find correct information
about the artist. Or worse still, we will find that incorrect
information is used by various web resources and services, which will
lead to negative consequences:

-   ‚òê The artist may be recommended to wrong audiences, and receive
    negative feedback, which will result in low ratings and difficulty
    in finding future audiences.
-   ‚òê The artist may not be found by correct audiences, resulting in low
    visibility.
-   ‚òê Low visibility or negative ratings will decrease current and
    future revenues.

The `Listen Local Opt-in Database` allows the artist (or the artist‚Äôs lawful
representative) to take control about the information available about
the artist, the artists‚Äô music works and music recordings on the
internet.

All the information in the `Opt-In Database` is protected by data
protection rules. We collect this information about the artists with
four objectives:

1.  Help the artist identifying and correcting incorrect information
    that may lead to wrong perception, low visibility or missed
    payments.
2.  Help the artist in easily communicating new or corrected
    information, relying on machine-to-machine communnication, to
    improve the perception, visibility and payments.
3.  Help the artist to participate in various support schemes (for
    national repertoires, local language use, minority languages, or
    correction of gender-based biases.)
4.  Carry out scientific research about data and metadata problems that
    put small language, small nation, and non-mainstream artists at a
    disadvantage to find audiences, visibility and income.

    
## Opt-In Form

The Opt-In Form is documented [here](https://documentation.listen-local.net/the-opt-in-form.html).

## Name

One of the most frequent metadata problem on music streaming services is
name ambiguity. There are many artists named ‚ÄòRain‚Äô. How can an
algorithm recommend the correct `Rain` to a user? How can we make sure
that the correct `Rain` is getting paid?

There are many national and international name authorities that give a
globally unique identifier for artists. Unfortunately, their use is not
mandatory yet in most web services. Name authorities are great starting
points to start name disambiguation, but first of all, we have to record
the various used names of the artist.

Recording the name of the artist, when it is noot already available in
various national or global encyclopedias, requries explicit opt-in from
the artist to the Listen Local Opt-In Database.

### Location data

Location is very important for connecting artists and audiences.
Stronger, and more profitable connections are made when music fans can
visit live performances, and have access to information about the
purchasing options of the artits‚Äô works, recordings, and merchandise.

Our service is particularly aiming to avoid the ‚Äúcolonization‚Äù of local
ecoystems by global artists and the global repertoire. We want to
increase the local visibility of artits, and we want to help artists to
find new audiences in specific locations (including potential export
destinations.)

Location-aware recommendations (both for artists and for
audiences/curators) requires recording location information.

Our write-in database contains the following information, which after
opt-in can be corrected by the artist:

We will collect further location specific information to increase the
likelihood of new matches between fans/curators and artists.

## Language

The use of language is very important in almost all music genres to
communicate with the audience. The use of language often allows to imply
the ethnicity or nationality of the artist. However, the use of language
can be determined by a competent listener or increasingly by AI
application.

In many countries, local content regulation incentives to use of the
local language content. Such incentives cannot work without recording
the information about the language of the lyrics and the titles.

Our opt-in databaase collect information about what people think about
the use of language of an artist. The opt-in database allows the artist
to control this information, and make corrections. Providing us with
this information is optional.

### Gender

There are many initiatives in place all over Europe to correct
historical biases against üë© non-male or üåà non-cis-male artists. Such
incentives only work with artists who reveal their gender
self-identification.

Our [Write-in Database](/data/write-in) contains the ‚Äúsubjective‚Äù information about the artist‚Äôs (publicly) perceived sex at birth or perceived gender. Our opt-in database gives the artist control over this information in the public domain about the artist.

When the artist opts-in to reveal his/her/their gender identification,
we add an ‚Äúobjective‚Äù gender variable next to the ‚Äúsubjective‚Äù
information, and whenever possible, we give instructions or assist
corrections.
